# DNA-SE: Towards Deep Neural-Net Assisted Semiparametric Estimation
DNA-SE is an approach for solving the parameter of interest in semi-parametric. We give 3 examples about missing not at random, sensitivity analysis in causal inference and transfer learning. DNA-SE proposes a method using deep neural network to estimate or calculate the parameters with the solution given by integral equation. Also it has a iterative alternating procedure with Monte Carlo integration and a new loss function.
